# ca-branching
Let's explore the branching feature of Git, called "haara" in Finnish. Start by initializing an empty Git
repo (repository) or use a suitable existing repo. Then, save a few files there using the commit command.

Once you are done, perform the following steps:

1. What command do you use to find out the name of the branch that is currently active?

2. Create a new branch named "development", and set it as the active branch.

3. Edit the files and make a commit of the changes.

4. Return to the original branch, e.g., "main". Do you see the changes you made in the files?

5. Return to the "development" branch. Have your changes been preserved?

Note: if you have already practices this using the command-line Git, repeat the above steps using Visual Studio Code's user interface (not the built-in terminal).
